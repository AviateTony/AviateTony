- 👋 Hi, I’m @AviateTony
- 👀 I’m interested in making a transition into the dev field and have started by learning journey today, October 17th. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code on FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and through a Udemy course covering full stack Javascript development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! I'm brand new to this and am interested in absorbing as much knowledge as I can.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on here anytime! I'm excited to meet others who are transitioning into tech careers.
